    This application was built to help me come up with ideas for meals to make for my household on my night to cook.
    The app is displayed in a way to help the user(mostly me) navigate the array of recipes in this database. It uses the free API at
    <a href="https://www.themealdb.com/api.php">The Meal DB</a>, allowing the user to interface the database and chooose recipes based on certain categories.
